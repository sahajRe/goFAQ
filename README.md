# goFAQ
The Go programming language introduction in the form of questions and answers.

## Why you have created this Go FAQ?

This document is created using my own Go notes. The official [Go website](https://golang.org/) has very good documentation, including [FAQ](https://golang.org/doc/faq).  

I'm trying to keep my notes simple and concise. I believe these notes will help beginners to get familiar with Go quickly. Therefore, sharing here. Contributions and suggestions are most welcomed!

Note: I've just started learning Go (June '17). This document will grow as I learn more.

## What is Go?

Go is an open source programming language (which means source code for its compiler, libraries and tools is freely available to anyone. Go here (pun intended): https://github.com/golang).  

Go is a compiled (intended to be fast compiled), statically typed language (similar to C, C++, Java). It has garbage collection (automatic memory management). It has built-in support for writing concurrent programs. 

By the way, one of the shortest complete sentences in the English language is 'Go.'.

## Who created the Go Programming language and when?

Go was conceived in September 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson at Google. It was publicly announced in November 2009. Go version 1 was released on 28th March 2012.

## What were the main motivations/goals to create another programming language?
* Fast compilation
* Easy to use dependency management
* Utilize the emergence of multicore processors by providing buit-in easy to use concurrency features
* Simple type system. (Go doesn't support type heirarchy)

## How to try Go programming?

As a starter, use the [Go playground](https://play.golang.org/). Recently, there is another similar [un-official service](https://goplay.space/).

You can also download and install the required tools on you local machine from [Go website](https://golang.org/).

## How is Go compared to C++ and Java?

Go in comparison of other programming languages. (work in progress, don't rely on this yet)
